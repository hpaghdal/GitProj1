# Definitions:
*Below are some common Git terminology:*

**Repository**:<br>
A directory or storage space where your projects can live. Sometimes GitHub users shorten this to “repo.”

**Clone**:<br>
Process of downloading an already presented git repository to your local system.

**Fork**:<br>
This produces a personal copy of someone else's project. Forking also allows the "manager" to accept commits from any developer without giving them write access to the official codebase.

**Branch**:<br>
Is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branch.

**Commit**:<br>
Is an individual change to a file or set of files. When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID ("SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when.

**Merge**:<br>
Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line.

**Checkout**:<br>
You can use git checkout on the command line to create a new branch, change your current working branch to a different branch, or even to switch to a different version of a file from a different branch with git checkout [branchname]  [path to file].

**Push**:<br>
The git push command allows you to send (or push) the commits from your local branch in your local Git repository to the remote repository.

**Pull**:<br>
The git pull command fetches and downloads content from the remote repository and integrates changes into the local repository.

**Remote Add**:<br>
command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at.
