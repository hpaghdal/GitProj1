## How the usage of Git, Docker, Automated Testing, and Continuous Integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company.

#### Here are five aspects of using Git, Docker, Automated Testing, and Continuous Integration that provides companies a competitive edge:


**1. Faster Release Cycles:** Speeding up the build and deploy cycle allows teams to get new features into production quicker, and reduce the ime to market a product.

**2. Reduced Risk:** By releasing new updates or features continuously, the risk of bugs in production is also reduced dramtically.

**3. Lower Costs:** Adopting a continuous development model lowers the costs by eliminating many of the fixed costs associated with building and testing changes to the application. For example, automated environment provisioning will reduce the costs associated with maintaining your own test infrastructure. By continuously committing your code, you’ll spend less time (and therefore money) on fixing bugs.

**4. Higher Quality Products:** Continuous integration enables stronger collaboration between developers, meaning bugs are found and fixed faster earlier in the development process. Running automated regression and parallel tests will improve test coverage, ensuring your application is bug-free and works across a wider range of environments. Continuously delivering smaller updates to your software will make most changes (and bugs) undetectable to the end user, resulting in happier customers.

**5. Better Business Advantage:** Moving to a continuous development model gives your team the flexibility to make alterations to your software on-the-go to meet new market trends and user needs. You’ll be able to meet rapidly changing demands and will turn your release process into a competitive advantage.
